# Layer Webhooks Services

[![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/layer-webhooks-services.svg)](https://npmjs.org/package/layer-webhooks-services)

The Layer Webhooks services integrates with the [Layer's services](http://layer.com), allowing for event handling when messages and conversations are created, deleted and changed. This node module is designed to work with express servers to quickly register and listen for events.

## Installation

    npm install layer-webhooks-services

## Usage

There are two types of services provided by this module:

* Registering webhooks
* Listening for webhooks

> Registering webhooks is an optional step, webhooks can also be registered from the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.layer.com).

## Setup

The Layer Webhooks Service depends upon [Kue](https://github.com/Automattic/kue) for managing jobs spawned by receiving a webhook. It is backed by Redis, which is also used by the Receipts service.  Initialization therefore will looks something like:

```javascript
var redis = require('redis').createClient(process.env.REDIS_URL);
var queue = require('kue').createQueue({
  redis: process.env.REDIS_URL
});

var WebhooksServices = require('layer-webhooks-services');
var lws = new WebhooksServices({
  token: process.env.LAYER_BEARER_TOKEN,
  appId: process.env.LAYER_APP_ID,
  redis: redis
});
```

> Note that Kue's `createQueue` function returns a singleton; this first call, and its parameters, define
the singleton that will be used throughout this module.

### Registering a webhook

```javascript
var webhook = {
  name: 'Webhook Example',  // An arbitrary name for your webhook
  path: '/webhook_example', // Your server URL path for the webhook
  events: ['message.sent']  // Events this webhook is listening to
};

// Register a webhook
lws.register({
  secret: 'my secret',
  url: 'https://mydomain.com/webhook',
  hooks: [webhook]
});
```

Running the above code will cause one of two results:

  1. A webhook will be registered on Layer's servers telling it what events are of interest,
  and what url to send those events to.
  2. If a webhook with the specified name already exists, the call to register will verify that the
  webhook is active, and will activate it if needed.

### Listening for a webhook

```javascript
var kue = require('kue');
var queue = kue.createQueue();

var express = require('express');
var app = express();

var webhook = {
  name: 'Webhook Example',
  path: '/webhook_example'
};

// Listen for a webhook
lws.listen({
  expressApp: app,
  secret: 'my secret',
  hooks: [webhook]
});

queue.process(webhook.name, function(job, done) {
  var webhookEvent = job.data;
  var message = webhookEvent.message;
  console.log('Message Received from: ' + message.sender.user_id);
});
```

The code above does two things:

  1. It sets up an endpoint listening for GET requests used by Layer's services to [validate](https://developer.layer.com/docs/webhooks#validate) an endpoint.  Validation is requried before Layer will start sending events to this service.
  2. It sets up an endpoint listening for events, and setting up a Kue process for you to handle those events.

Notes:

  * If you use the `listen` method, it requires an [Express App](http://expressjs.com/).
  * It is required that your Express server listens to secure SSL request i.e. use `HTTPS`.
  * The `path` property of your webhook definition is used to specify the path that the server will listen for requests at.

### Combined Usage

While you can register a webhook on Layer's Developer Dashboard and only use `listen()`,Â you can also use
the following combined usage:

```javascript
var webhook = {
  name: 'Webhook Example',
  events: ['message.sent'],
  path: '/webhook_example'
};

var secret = 'my secret';

lws.register({
  secret: secret,
  url: 'https://mydomain.com/webhook',
  hooks: [webhook]
});

lws.listen({
  expressApp: app,
  secret: secret,
  hooks: [webhook]
});

queue.process(webhook.name, function(job, done) {
  var webhookEvent = job.data;
  var message = webhookEvent.message;
  console.log('Message Received from: ' + message.sender.user_id);
});
```

### Listening for Unread or Undelivered Messages

A common use case is to listen for Messages that have been unread or undelivered for some period of time and then notifying people that they have a message waiting for them (or that their message could not be delivered to all participants).

The `receipts` operation provides shorthand for this.  It is basically the same as the `listen` operation, but supports parameters specific managing delayed testing of receipt status.

```javascript
var webhook = {
  name: 'Inline Receipts Demo',

  // Path for express app to listen on
  path: '/receipts',

  // These events are needed for the register call
  events: ['message.sent', 'message.read', 'message.delivered', 'message.deleted'],

  receipts: {
    // How long to wait before checking if the Message is still unread
    delay: '10 minutes',

    // Any user whose recipient status is 'sent' or 'delivered' (not 'read')
    // is of interest once the delay has completed.
    reportForStatus: ['sent', 'delivered'],

    // True, false, or a function if you need Identity data for the senders and recipients included
    // in each callback.  A value of true will generate additional traffic and may have costs
    // to yours service.
    identities: false
  }
};

var secret = 'my secret';

lws.register({
  secret: secret,
  url: 'https://mydomain.com/webhook',
  hooks: [webhook]
});

// Listen for events from Layer's Services
lws.receipts({
  expressApp: app,
  secret: secret,
  hooks: [webhook]
});

// Any Messages that are unread by any participants will be passed into this job
// after the delay specified above has passed.
queue.process(webhook.name, function(job, done) {
  var message = job.data.message;
  var recipients = job.data.recipients;

  console.log('Receipts Sample: The following users didn\'t read message ' + message.id + ' (' + message.parts[0].body + '): ');
  console.log('Receipts Sample: RECIPIENTS: ' + recipients.join(', '));
  done();
});
```

## The Hook Definition

Each hook can have the following properties:

  * `name`: This can be an arbitrary string; the name will be used to help identify a webhook so that only a single instance of this webhook is ever created.
  * `events`: An array of events that are of interest to our webhook. Refer to [documentation](https://developer.layer.com/docs/webhooks) for a list of all events.
  * `path`: The path is used both to tell Layer's servers where to send webhook events to, and tells the `listen()` method where to listen for incoming events.

## Initialization

### new WebhooksServices(config)

Layer Webhooks services constructor is initialized with the following configuration values:

  - `token` - Layer Platform API token which can be obtained from [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.layer.com)
  - `appId` - Layer application ID
  - `redis` - [Redis](https://github.com/NodeRedis/node_redis) client instance

### lws.register(options)

Register your webhooks with Layer's servers.

  * `secret`: An arbitrary string you provide used to validate that events received by your server come from Layer's Servers, and not some unknown source.
  * `url`: When registering a webhook with Layer's services, the `url` + each webhook's `path` property is used to tell the server where to send each event.
  * `hooks`: An array of Hook Definitions.

### lws.listen(options)

Listen for incoming events from Layer's servers.

  * `expressApp`: An expressjs application instance.
  * `secret`: An arbitrary string you provide used to validate that events received by your server come from Layer's Servers, and not some unknown source.
  * `hooks`: An array of Hook Definitions.

### lws.receipts(options)

Listen for incoming events from Layer's servers, and trigger a job if after
a specified delay, there are recipients whose state matches your `states` parameter.

This call uses the `listen` operation, but has an extra `receipts` parameter:

  * `expressApp`: An expressjs application instance.
  * `secret`: An arbitrary string you provide used to validate that events received by your server come from Layer's Servers, and not some unknown source.
  * `hooks`: An array of Hook Definitions.

Custom Hook Parameters:

  * `receipts`: Parameters specific to the receipts operation:
    * `delay`: If its a number, then its the number of milliseconds to wait before creating the job for you to process.  If its a string, then see [this utility](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ms) for how this is processed.
    * `reportForStatus`: Array of strings; this call should report on all recipients whose state matches any of the states you list. Possible values are 'sent', 'delivered', 'read'.  ['sent'] will report on all recipients who are still in 'sent' state for triggering 'undelivered' processing.  ['sent', 'delivered'] will report on all users who are either 'sent' OR 'delivered' meaning anyone who hasn't read the Message.
    * `identities`: If false, no identity data is loaded.  If true, then any identity data registered with Layer's Identity Servers are returned (this generates additional network requests and may have impact on your service).  If a function is provided, then you can
    provide your own means of providing Identity data.

#### The `identities` callback

Your `identities` function takes a userId and a callback:

```javascript
var hook = {
  delay: '30 min',
  identities: function(userId, callback) {
    request(myUrl + userId, function(err, res, body) {
      callback(err, body);
    });
  }
}
```

## Webhook Events

Your callbacks will be called with Events objects provided by Layer Services. Make sure you read the Layer [Webhooks Documentation](https://developer.layer.com/docs/webhooks) to get more information.

## Examples

There are a number of examples in the [examples](./examples) folder.  You can run them all with `npm start`, or just run the basic examples with `npm run basic`.
